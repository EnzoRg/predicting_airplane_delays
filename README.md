# Predicting Airplane Delays üõ´‚è±
This repository contains the challenge lab from AWS Academy Machine Learning Foundations.

## Introducing the business scenario
You work for a travel booking website that wants to improve the customer experience for flights that were delayed. The company wants to create a feature to let customers know if the flight will be delayed because of weather when they book the flight to or from the busiest airports for domestic travel in the US. 

You are tasked with solving part of this problem by using machine learning (ML) to identify whether the flight will be delayed because of weather. You have been given access to the dataset about the on-time performance of domestic flights that are operated by large air carriers. You can use this data to train an ML model to predict if the flight will be delayed for the busiest airports.
